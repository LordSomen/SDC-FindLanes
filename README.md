## Description

In this project we are trying to detect the lanes in the road with the help of Computer Vision, video and image analysis algorithms , which will help a SDC understand the lane.
used OpenCV, Numpy, Python, Moviepy library to detect and draw lines on the detected road.
 


## Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Computer vision, Machine Learning, data visualization.

## Lessons Learned

We have Learned how to analyze video feed, detect specific part of the video feed required for the self driving car to understand the road
and mark it with atmost accuracy.
one of the main challenges is to optimize our model to detect the road when the car is taking turn, for those situation we have to
tweak the parameters to detect them as accurately as possible.
